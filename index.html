            <p>Bangladesh, a land of natural beauty and resources, blessed with around 310 rivers. But recently, this
                blessing turned into bustle when the monsoon started in July. Heavy rainfall started throughout the
                country and flow of large-scale water leading to massive flooding situation in low lying areas of
                Northern, north-eastern and south-eastern districts. Now thousands of family is flood affected, lost
                their houses, livestock, struggling with contagious diseases waiting for support and relief.
